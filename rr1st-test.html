				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<img src="IMG_2017.JPG"/>
				<p>My name is Ryan Ray. Iâ€™m interested in aviation, electronic, and solve challenging problems.</p>
				<p>I have worked in the aviation industry over 6 years, and began my career as an Instructor Assistant after receiving my professional training and degree from Civil Aviation Technology College of Iran. I started my career with Iran Aseman Airlines in Feb 2009 as an avionic technician. Since the time, I have worked on many airplanes (Fokker 100, Boeing727, ATR72, Falcon20, MD80) in Line, Hangar and Overhaul Shop (Assembly, Disassembly, Installation, Systems Troubleshooting, Repair, C and D Checks, Service Bulletins, Bench Test).</p>
				<p>I moved to The United States in May 2013. I started my first job as a manager in Proven Systems LLC in Arlington, VA. November 2014, I got into 3D Systems Incorporation as a test and repair technician. I'm working in The TWP company as an industrial maintenance technician journeyman. And I would like the opportunity to improve my experience and skill ability in electronics and aviation.</p>
				<p>My social development allows me to work well in teams and get along well with fellow workers.</p>
